# leaflet-challenge

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. 

The visualization that is in the LeafLet-Challenge file will show the earthquakes around the world that has occured in the last hour. The index.html file is an interactive map that will show you the geo coordinates of where the Earthquake occured. It will also tell you when, where, and the magnitude of the earthquake.
